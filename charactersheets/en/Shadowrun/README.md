This tool is made for *Shadowrun* and is compatible with the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th editions. It aims to make dice rolling easier for playing Shadowrun and keep track of pools during combat turns.

This is not a full fledge character sheet. Rather, it is a tool to manage most used stats and a rolling tools with damage monitors and pool management. 

For the time being, the full character sheet needs to be rest on a external media. Statistics entered on *RCES SR-RollManager* are solely for rolling purposes.

If I find the motivation, new pages with specific character sheets content will be added to eventually manage all aspects of character sheets (cyberware, spells, vehicules, cyberdecks, etc.). There is no aim to reproduce a known character sheet design, but some eye-candy would be nice.

Playing with more recent editions of Shadowrun is probably possible with some workarounds or minor adaptations.

Feel free to contribute!
